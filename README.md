People spend most of their day at home, they wake up, go to work, then come back and stay until the next day. We all try to beautify our home environment through the addition of sometimes extravagant furniture and flowers. But we do not pay that much attention to the air inside our home.

Studies show that indoor air we breath in most of the day is 3 to 4 times more polluted than the air outside our house. This refers to the higher amount of carbon dioxide as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are harmful for our lives.

Studies show that indoor air we breath in most of the day is 3 to 4 times more polluted than the air outside our house. This refers to the higher amount of carbon dioxide as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are harmful for our lives.

Studies show that the presence of carbon dioxide in excessive amounts can lead to a lower level of concentration, this is because a higher level of carbon dioxide would replace the oxygen that should be present in the air reducing the oxygenation of the brain leading to reduced brain function.

VOCs also have an impact on human health. Studies show that over 30% of households have excessive levels of VOCs. These can lead to problems such as difficulty breathing, and lengthened exposure can lead to nasal cancer.

So, what can we do to make our home environment healthier? Air purifiers can filter the VOCs out of the air easily, but there is a catch; the cost of modern air purifiers can be quite high. But we do not want to have an air purifier that would run all the time because that would waste energy.

We need our devices to be connected to the internet and run without the need for us to press buttons and plug them in.

Smart air purifiers are the solution! These devices purify the air automatically whenever excessive impurities were detected. But the cost of implementing solutions like this are excessive, and on top of that, there is very little information given to the user about air quality.

So, what about carbon dioxide? Well, simple ventilators and fans can redirect the impurities outside but running them all day can use up a significant amount of energy. So, what if you could automate both an air purifier and a fan to ensure that the air quality indoors is optimal at all times?

This is where IntlAir comes in, IntlAir is a device powered by the Azure Sphere board which monitors the indoor air quality by reading the TVOC and carbon dioxide levels and turning on the air purifier and/or the fan, respectively. The device also monitors barometric pressure to ensure that the atmosphere is optimum.

This way, any fan system and purifier can be modernised and brought into the age of IoT in minutes, no need to purchase new, expensive systems. IntlAir can significantly reduce the amount of energy used by these devices and provides the user with a comprehensive dashboard and application where they can visualise both the air quality in the home, and when the purifier was running.

This gives the user full control over the data and ensures that the air in their home is always clean. Bring your home into the future with a smart, cost-effective implementation.
